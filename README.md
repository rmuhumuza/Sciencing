# Sciencing with Python and Jupyter notebooks and other significant tools supporting scientific research and interactive computing
In this playground I am creating various code snipates using interactive jupyter notebooks. The C++ and Python snipates employ object-oriented programming techniques in reusable classes and data structures that automate certain analytical processes encountered in engineering.
